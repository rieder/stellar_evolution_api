# stellar_evolution_api

In this repository we aim to define a common application programming interface (API) for stellar evolution codes used in astrophysical simulations.

We aim to provide
- [ ] signatures for a minimum subset of functions needed to run a stellar evolution simulation, in various programming languages
- [ ] signatures for optional functions for such simulations
- [ ] a units library to ensure conversions to and from SI are done in a consistent way
- [ ] tests to check compatibility with this API
