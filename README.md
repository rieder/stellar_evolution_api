# stellar_evolution_api

In this repository we aim to define a common application programming interface (API) for stellar evolution codes used in astrophysical simulations.

We aim to provide
- signatures for a minimum subset of functions needed to run a stellar evolution simulation, in various programming languages
- signatures for optional functions for such simulations
- tests to check compatibility with this API
